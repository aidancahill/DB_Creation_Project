Introduction

The Mobile Brow Lounge(MBL) is a mobile micro blading studio owned and operated by Rachelle Fallon. 
The service provided by the MBL is permanent makeup and customers are mainly women but sometimes men. 
The primary record keeping channel for her business was mainly paper documents that were medical history 
release documents, and an agreement of the understanding of the type of procedure being performed. A need 
for a customer database became more prevalent the more customer procedures were being performed.

Purpose

The purpose of the software is to populate a database of customers for the MBL that contains the customer's 
Name, Date of procedure, Email, phone number, Date of birth, Age, the procedure done, and how they heard of the MBL. 
The results generated from the vision api project could not be used for a true data analysis. The results were inconsistent 
so to improve consistency the vision api route was removed and manual entry was needed to improve those results. 

Intended Audience

The audience of this software is the business owner of the Mobile Brow Lounge so that insights can be pulled from 
the extracted data and leveraged as marketing KPI for an ad campaign.

Intended Use

The use of the software and the created database is to reveal insights about the MBL and its main customer base. 
This information is then used as leverage to create ad campaigns, email marketing campaigns, and social media posts.

Scope

The scope of the project entails the customers of the MBL and the permanent makeup artist Rachelle Fallon. 
How she can use these data insights to bring in more clients and grow the small business and streamline that 
process by removing the need for paper record keeping.

Overall Description

The software consists of two main insert statements that comprise all of the Mobile Brow Lounge clients and the 
procedures that were done. The database is created, used, and populated using python. Furthermore after the database 
is created and populated, the results were imported into tableau and visualizations were created. The visualizations 
explain that the main customers that come to the MBL are from ages twenty to forty. The main ways the clients found out 
about the MBL are from Instagram, Facebook, and through friends. Lastly the main procedure done for the client was microblading 
or permanently tattooed eyebrows. These insights could not have been gleaned from the vision api style extraction because of how 
inconsistent the results came back.
